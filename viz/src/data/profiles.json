An engineer who raised $2M in seed funding for Acme Labs (privacy-preserving AI), he arrived in SF in Oct 2025 and is now caught between runway anxiety and audacious technical vision. He doesn't just build software — he architects perception systems, memory infrastructures, and autonomous companions with a blend of rigorous engineering and philosophical depth. His 12-year GitHub history traces the arc from early ML experiments to ALMA-inspired meta-learning, and he moves fluidly between researching academic papers, debugging ContextMem benchmarks at Acme Labs, and shipping hackathon projects that push Claude Agent SDK to its limits.",
