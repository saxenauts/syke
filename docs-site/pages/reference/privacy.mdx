# Privacy

## Local Storage

<Callout type="info">
**Your data stays local.** All timeline data lives in `~/.syke/data/{user}/syke.db` on your machine. Nothing is uploaded to external services except during memory synthesis.
</Callout>

## API Transmission

<Callout type="warning">
**During memory synthesis**, event data is sent to the Anthropic API for the synthesis agent to analyze. Same trust model as using Claude directly — your data goes to Anthropic's API, processed under their [data policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy), not used for training.
</Callout>

## Content Filtering

Pre-ingestion filter runs before events enter SQLite:

- Strips credential patterns (API keys, tokens, passwords, SSH keys)
- Skips private messaging content (WhatsApp logs, DMs pasted into AI)

Content that never enters the timeline can never be sent to an LLM.

## What Syke Never Stores

The content filter explicitly strips:

- **API keys and tokens** — `sk-ant-...`, `ghp_...`, `Bearer ...` patterns
- **Passwords** — detected via common assignment patterns
- **SSH keys** — `-----BEGIN` block detection
- **Private messages** — WhatsApp logs, DMs pasted into AI conversations
- **Gmail message bodies** — only subjects and snippets are captured

## Consent Tiers

| Source | Consent |
|--------|---------|
| GitHub | None required (public data) |
| Claude Code | `--yes` flag or interactive prompt |
| ChatGPT | `--yes` flag or interactive prompt |
| Gmail | `--yes` flag or interactive prompt |

## Strategy Files

Contain search query patterns only — no user content. Safe to version control.

## Data Deletion

To remove all Syke data for a user, delete their data directory:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.syke/data/{user_id}/
```

This removes the SQLite database, profile, metrics, and logs. There is no cloud storage to clean up.
