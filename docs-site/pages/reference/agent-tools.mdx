# Agent Tools Reference

Syke exposes 3 CLI commands that AI agents (and humans) use to interact with your memory.

<Callout type="info">
**Pattern**: `syke context` first → `syke ask` if needed → `syke record` when something happens.

`context` and `record` work without any API key. `ask` requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `claude login` (Claude Code Max/Team/Enterprise).
</Callout>

## syke context

**Start here.** Returns the memex — the synthesized map of who this person is. Instant, zero-cost local file read.

Not a database lookup — it's a living model synthesized from cross-platform signals (code, conversations, commits, emails). Updated every sync cycle.

```bash
syke context                    # Print memex to stdout
syke context --format json      # JSON format
```

**When to use:**
```
"What is the user working on?"           → syke context (it's right there)
"How do they prefer error messages?"     → syke context (communication style)
"What did they think about X 3 weeks ago?" → syke ask (needs timeline exploration)
```

---

## syke ask

Ask any question about the user in natural language. Syke's internal agent reads the memex, then explores the memory layer and raw timeline to find the answer.

More thorough than direct queries, but takes 5–25 seconds and costs ~$0.10–0.20 per call.

**Requires:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `claude login` (Claude Code Max/Team/Enterprise).

```bash
syke ask "What did they work on last week?"
syke ask "What do they think about RAG architectures?"
syke ask "Find the decision about JWT vs session tokens"
```

Use `ask` for anything `context` doesn't answer. The agent has 10 read tools internally — it searches memories, follows links, cross-references platforms, and browses the timeline.

## record

Push a meaningful observation back into the user's timeline. Natural language, no structure needed.

The daemon already captures sessions, commits, and conversations automatically. Use `record` for signals the daemon can't see: decisions made in conversation, preferences expressed, frustrations, insights.

```bash
syke record "User decided to use PostgreSQL over MongoDB"
syke record "Finished the auth refactor and merged PR #42"
syke record "Prefers dark mode, mentioned it twice today"
```

**When to call:** Decisions, task completions, strong preferences, new collaborations, project shifts.
**When NOT to call:** Every message (too noisy), trivial observations, info already in the live context.

## How Distribution Works

Syke distributes context via file includes — no MCP server needed:

```
context_files.py → writes ~/.syke/data/{user}/CLAUDE.md (memex with preamble)
ensure_claude_include() → adds @include into ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
Claude Code → reads ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md at session start (follows @includes)
SKILL.md → installed at ~/.claude/skills/syke/SKILL.md (agent instructions)
```

Every AI coding session automatically gets your full context on startup.
