# Context Distribution

How Syke gets your context into every AI coding session — automatically, with zero configuration after setup.

<Callout type="info">
**No MCP server needed.** Syke distributes context via CLAUDE.md file includes. Every Claude Code session reads your memex automatically on startup — instant context, no tool calls required.
</Callout>

## How It Works

```
syke setup --yes
  ↓
1. Writes memex to ~/.syke/data/{user}/CLAUDE.md
2. Adds @include to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
3. Installs SKILL.md to ~/.claude/skills/syke/
4. Starts daemon (syncs every 15 minutes)
  ↓
Every new Claude Code session reads your context automatically
```

The daemon keeps the memex fresh. Every 15 minutes it collects new signals, runs incremental synthesis if needed, and updates the memex file. Next session sees updated context.

## What Gets Injected

The memex — a synthesized map of who you are:

```markdown
# Memex — dev

## Identity
Full-stack engineer building AI developer tools. Python, TypeScript, React.

## What's Active
- **Syke v0.4.3** [high] (github, claude-code): Shipping streaming ask,
  post-release audit. 29 commits pushed today.
- **Client project** [medium] (gmail, github): API integration due Friday.

## Context
Deep in release mode. Communication style: direct, fast-paced, technical.
Prefers concise answers. Working late nights this week.
```

## Agent Commands

Three commands are available in any Claude Code session:

| Command | What It Does | Cost |
|---------|-------------|------|
| `syke context` | Print the memex (instant, local file read) | Free |
| `syke ask "question"` | Agentic search across memories + timeline | ~$0.10–0.20 |
| `syke record "note"` | Push an observation into memory | Free |

See [Agent Tools Reference](/reference/agent-tools) for full documentation.

## Client Compatibility

Syke's CLAUDE.md distribution works with any tool that reads `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

| Client | Support | How |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Claude Code | ✅ Automatic | Reads `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` with `@includes` |
| OpenCode | ✅ Automatic | Reads Claude's CLAUDE.md |
| OpenClaw | ✅ Automatic | Reads Claude's CLAUDE.md |
| Cursor | Manual | Copy memex to project `.cursorrules` |
| Other tools | Manual | `syke context` outputs memex to stdout |

## Keeping Context Fresh

The daemon handles this automatically:

```bash
syke daemon start     # Start background sync (every 15 min)
syke daemon status    # Check if running, last sync time
syke sync             # Manual one-time sync
```

Every cycle: collect signals → synthesize if new data → update memex → next session sees it.
