# How It Works

Syke runs a continuous loop: collect signals from your platforms, synthesize memories from them, distribute context to every AI tool, and collect new signals back. Your identity evolves as you do.

<Callout type="info">
**Bidirectional sync.** Any AI tool can read your context via CLAUDE.md *and* write events back via `syke record`. Your Claude Code session logs what you build. Your custom agent logs decisions. Everything feeds the living memory on next sync cycle.
</Callout>

## Ingestion

Platform adapters read data sources and produce `Event` objects stored in SQLite. Each adapter handles its own auth, pagination, and deduplication.

One event per session — not per message. A Claude Code session about "refactoring auth" is one event, not 50. Content capped at 50K chars.

## Memory Synthesis

Memory synthesis is what makes Syke different. After new events are ingested, the synthesis agent reads the **memex** (its navigational map of this person), then decides what to do with each new event using 15 memory tools.

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `get_memex()` | Read the navigational map — orient before exploring |
| `search_memories(query)` | FTS5/BM25 search across all memories |
| `search_evidence(query)` | Search raw events for ground truth |
| `follow_links(memory_id)` | Navigate connected memories |
| `create_memory(content, ...)` | Write new knowledge from events |
| `supersede_memory(id, ...)` | Replace outdated knowledge, keep history |
| `create_link(source, target, reason)` | Connect related memories |

The agent decides what's worth remembering, how to organize it, when to retire old knowledge. No heuristics — just language.

<Callout>
**Evidence ≠ inference.** Raw events (what happened) are immutable. Memories (what it means) are mutable and agent-written. The synthesis agent reads events and writes memories — the two layers never mix.
</Callout>

See [Memory Architecture](/architecture/memory) for the full three-layer design.

Three CLI commands expose context to any AI tool: `syke context` (read), `syke ask` (explore), `syke record` (write). See [Context Distribution](/guide/mcp-server) for details.
