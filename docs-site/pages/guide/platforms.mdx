# Platforms

What each data source gives Syke.

## Claude Code

**Why it matters:** Claude Code sessions are the richest signal. They capture what you're building, how you think about problems, and what tools you reach for.

**Method:** Local JSONL parsing from `~/.claude/`. Dual-store adapter reads both project-level and global transcript stores.

**Data:** Sessions, tool calls, projects, git branches, conversation flow.

```bash
syke --user you ingest claude-code --yes
```

## ChatGPT

**Why it matters:** Research threads, brainstorming sessions, learning patterns. Often captures interests and curiosities that don't appear in code.

**Method:** ZIP export parsing (Settings > Data Controls > Export).

**Data:** Conversations, topics, timestamps, message flow.

```bash
syke --user you ingest chatgpt --file ~/Downloads/chatgpt-export.zip --yes
```

## GitHub

**Why it matters:** What you actually ship. Commit patterns, project scope, tech stack preferences.

**Method:** REST API (public data, or with `GITHUB_TOKEN` for private repos).

**Data:** Repos, commits, issues, PRs, stars, README content.

```bash
syke --user you ingest github --username your-username
```

## Gmail

**Why it matters:** Communication patterns, professional context, who you interact with.

**Method:** OAuth API (via gog CLI or Python OAuth fallback).

**Data:** Subjects, snippets, labels, sent patterns.

<Callout type="warning">
**Privacy.** Gmail captures subjects and snippets only — message bodies are never stored. The content filter strips credentials before events enter SQLite.
</Callout>

```bash
syke --user you ingest gmail
```

## MCP Push (Any Client)

Any MCP client can push events back to Syke. Your Claude Code session can log what you're building. Your custom agent can log decisions.

```json
{
  "source": "my-agent",
  "event_type": "decision",
  "title": "Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB",
  "content": "Selected PostgreSQL for the new API..."
}
```
