# Distribution

How Syke gets your context into every AI tool you use.

## Federated Push/Pull

<Callout type="info">
**Every MCP client is both consumer and contributor.** Pull your identity to personalize responses. Push observations back to enrich it. The profile grows from every interaction across every tool.
</Callout>

You're in Claude Code building a new API. Syke logs it. You switch to Cursor — it already knows what you built. You ask ChatGPT a research question — next sync, that research enriches your profile. Every tool contributes. Every tool benefits.

The MCP server supports bidirectional context flow:

- **Pull**: Any client reads your profile, searches your timeline
- **Push**: Any client writes events back — decisions, observations, tasks

Your Claude Code session logs what you're building. Your custom agent logs its decisions. Everything feeds back into the living profile on next sync.

## MCP Server

FastMCP server with 8 tools. Runs as a subprocess via stdio (for Claude Code) or as an HTTP server.

```bash
# stdio (Claude Code integration)
syke --user you serve --transport stdio

# HTTP (other clients)
syke --user you serve --transport http
```

See [MCP Tools Reference](/reference/mcp-tools) for full tool documentation.

## Formatters

Four output formats from the same synthesized identity:

<Tabs items={['CLAUDE.md', 'USER.md', 'Markdown', 'JSON']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
Injected into Claude Code projects — follows the `.claude/CLAUDE.md` convention.

## File Injection

Write your profile directly into any project:

```bash
syke --user you inject --target /path/to/project/.claude --format claude-md
```

This creates a `CLAUDE.md` in the target directory. Claude Code reads it automatically on every session.

## Continuous Sync

The daemon keeps distribution fresh. Every 15 minutes:
1. Re-ingest sources (dedup skips unchanged data)
2. Run incremental synthesis if new events found
3. Update distribution files
4. Skip entirely when nothing changed (cost: $0)

Identity that drifts with you — no manual re-runs needed.
