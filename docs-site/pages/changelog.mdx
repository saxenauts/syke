<Callout type="info">
**Current release: v0.3.2 — "Claude Code Auth: Clean Slate"** (Feb 18, 2026). Session auth is now the primary path for all Claude Code users. MCP config and daemon no longer bake in API keys. 378 tests passing.
</Callout>

## [0.3.2] — Feb 18 — "No Key Required"

Session auth is now the primary path for all Claude Code users.

- **fix:** MCP config no longer bakes in `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — handled at startup via `config.py`
- **fix:** Cron/daemon entry no longer embeds `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the crontab line
- **fix:** `ask()` uses Claude Code session auth by default
- **fix:** Daemon LaunchAgent plist no longer bakes in `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **fix:** `setup` no longer persists `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` when `claude login` auth is present
- **feat:** Setup shows cost notice when API-key-only path is used (~$0.78/build, ~$0.02/ask)
- 67 new tests for `claude_code` and `github_` ingestion adapters (378 total)

## [0.3.0] — Feb 18 — "The Agent Knows Itself"

Self-update and version drift detection.

- **feat:** `syke self-update` — upgrades syke to the latest PyPI release, handles pipx/pip/uvx/source install methods, stops/restarts daemon around the upgrade
- **feat:** `syke/version_check.py` — stdlib-only PyPI checker with 24h disk cache, zero new dependencies
- **feat:** Daemon version drift detection — `_sync_cycle` logs a WARN and inserts a deduped timeline event per new version discovered
- **feat:** `daemon-status` version display — shows installed version and cached update-available notice (zero network cost)
- 16 new tests (304 total)

## [0.2.8] — Feb 16 — "Ship-Ready"

Cross-platform daemon support, API key persistence, code hardening, docs completeness.

- **feat:** Linux cron backend — `install_cron`, `uninstall_cron`, `cron_is_running` for daemon support on Linux
- **feat:** Platform dispatch — `install_and_start`, `stop_and_unload`, `get_status` auto-select launchd (macOS) or cron (Linux)
- **feat:** Claude Desktop MCP injection works on Linux (`~/.config/Claude/`)
- **feat:** Persist `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `~/.syke/.env` during setup — cron, MCP subprocesses, and non-interactive shells find the key without `.zshrc`
- **fix:** `generate_plist` accepts custom `interval` parameter instead of hardcoded 900
- **fix:** `install_launchd` sets plist to chmod 600 for API key security
- **fix:** `ask()` returns clear message when API key is missing instead of cryptic SDK error
- **fix:** `query_timeline` source list corrected — removed stubs (twitter, youtube), added claude-code
- **docs:** Changelog, contributing, architecture, README synced to current state
- 297 tests passing

## [0.2.7] — Feb 16 — "Seamless Agent Install"

Fresh agent installs now work end-to-end without manual debugging.

- **fix:** Auto-unset `CLAUDECODE` env var before perception so Agent SDK works inside Claude Code sessions
- **fix:** Guard Step 4 against `None` profile crash when perception fails
- **fix:** Split setup final summary into three cases: success, API-key-but-no-profile, no-API-key
- **feat:** GitHubAdapter auto-detects token via `gh auth token` when `GITHUB_TOKEN` is unset
- **docs:** MCP server instructions include "First Session" guidance for agents encountering no profile
- 276 tests

## [0.2.6] — Feb 16 — "The Two-Step Fix"

Fixes the critical bugs that broke the two-step setup flow (setup without key → add key → rebuild).

- **fix:** `sync --rebuild` works when 0 new events — previously early-returned before reaching profile update
- **fix:** `setup` re-run with API key detects existing events in DB
- **fix:** `sync` handles nested Claude Code session errors gracefully
- 273 tests

## [0.2.5] — Feb 16 — "Smooth Onboarding"

Graceful handling when setup runs inside Claude Code.

- **fix:** `syke setup` no longer crashes when run inside a Claude Code session — perception is skipped with a clear message

## [0.2.4] — Feb 16 — "Zero Friction"

Agent-native fresh install — one command, zero prerequisites.

- **feat:** Optional API key — `syke setup --yes` works without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **feat:** Absolute path resolution for MCP configs (3-tier: source → pip → uvx)
- **feat:** Claude Desktop support — setup injects Syke into Desktop MCP config
- **feat:** Smart daemon plist — correct binary path, API key in environment
- **feat:** Default user detection via `getpass.getuser()`
- 272 tests

## [0.2.3] — Feb 16 — "The Spider's Web"

ALMA meta-learning experiments tracked, incremental perception, comprehensive doc audit. 257 tests.

## [0.2.2] — Feb 15 — "The Right Database"

Harden MCP push pipeline: metadata parsing, type validation, format safety. Fix DATA_DIR to always resolve to `~/.syke/data` regardless of install method (PyPI or source). Added 4 new push pipeline tests. 244 tests total.

## [0.2.1] — Feb 15 — "The Agent Remembers (CI Fix)"

Fix CI test failures when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set. The `ask()` MCP test now skips gracefully in CI. Added API key requirement documentation.

## [0.2.0] — Feb 15 — "The Daemon Awakens"

Background sync daemon ships as core feature with `daemon-start`, `daemon-stop`, `daemon-status` CLI commands. Added `ask()` MCP tool for agentic natural language queries against the timeline. Added `world_state` field to perception output. Cost optimization: daemon skips perception when no new events exist.

## [0.1.1] — Feb 14 — "The System Remembers"

Docs site on Nextra, GitHub Actions CI pipeline, issue/PR templates, tbump release infrastructure, version bump automation.

## [0.1.0] — Feb 13 — "The System Sees"

MCP server with 8 tools (pull + push), pre-ingestion content filter, 4 output formats (JSON, Markdown, CLAUDE.md, USER.md), viz site with 14 interactive sections, 244 tests across 17 test files.

## [0.0.4] — Feb 12 — "The Agent Evolves"

ALMA-inspired strategy evolution. 12 benchmark runs on real data, peak 94.3% quality at $0.60/run (67% cheaper than legacy). Strategy v1 discovered that concepts beat project names.

## [0.0.3] — Feb 11 — "Three Agents, One Identity"

Multi-agent perception: 3 Sonnet sub-agents (timeline, patterns, voice) explore in parallel, Opus synthesizes. 100% source coverage, richer cross-platform threads.

## [0.0.2] — Feb 10 — "The Agent Explores"

Agent SDK rewrite of perception. 6 custom MCP tools for interactive exploration. Coverage gating via `PermissionResultDeny` hooks. Active exploration replaces passive context dump.

## [0.0.1] — Feb 9 — "Foundation"

Core pipeline: 4 platform adapters (Claude Code dual-store, ChatGPT ZIP, GitHub REST, Gmail OAuth), SQLite timeline with WAL mode, legacy single-shot perception with Opus 4.6 extended thinking.
