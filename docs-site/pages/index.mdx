# Syke — Agentic Memory

Your digital footprint — code, conversations, commits, emails — synthesized into a living, self-evolving model of who you are. Runs as a daemon. Feeds every AI tool you use via MCP.

<Callout type="info">
Not a retrieval system. Syke synthesizes who you are across platforms and keeps that model current — so every AI tool you work with actually knows you.
</Callout>

**One command to get started:**

```bash
uvx syke setup --yes
```
